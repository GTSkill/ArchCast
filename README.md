# ArchCast
Caster system mainly for creating gun systems with both bullet drop and travel time.

The example should explain how to use this pretty well although it doesnt use all of the functionality of the module the rest shouldnt be hard to figure out I am happy to help if anyone needs help with getting things to work the way they want to or has any suggestions to improve the code.

Idea and some inspiration from the FastCast module(https://devforum.roblox.com/t/making-a-combat-game-with-ranged-weapons-fastcast-may-be-the-module-for-you/)
